     <h3 class="bodytitle">Life Before RED</h3>
     <p><b>Hometown:</b> I was born in Montreal, but grew up in Vancouver for most of my life.</p>
     <p>Before applying to RED, I got a Bachelor of Science from UBC. I originally wanted to study comp sci, but my mom discouraged it at the time. One day, I saw her struggling to turn on a computer, and I had a vision of myself struggling to turn on my grandchildren's hologram. In this rapidly growing field of tech, I knew I did not want to fall behind. Over the years, my passion in this area grew and eventually, it led me to apply for RED.
     <h3 class="bodytitle">Secret Talent</h3>
     <p>I memorized 753 digits of pi for a Grade 7 math contest (I won!). I can still recite about 100 digits today.
                         
     <h3 class="bodytitle">Best Travel Experience</h3>
     <p> In February 2018, I embarked on a backpacking trip to Southeast Asia. What was suppose to only be a two month long trip extended to five months. I started in Thailand and after I decided to extend my backpacking trip, I visited Laos, Vietnam, and Indonesia. The trip gave me the opportunities to do things that would have normally been out of my comfort zone, including scuba diving, cliff jumping, a week-long motorbike tour in Vietnam, and I had the opportunity to paint a mural in Bangkok and Pai, Thailand! Both times were "Rick and Morty" themed. I got to meet like-minded travelers from all over the world, experience different types of food and learn new cultures.
