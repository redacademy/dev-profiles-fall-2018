                    <p>Before I came to RED I went to three different colleges or institutions. I figured if I couldn't study at a traditional school I might as well try something I enjoyed.</p>
                    <h2>Secret Talent</h2>
                    <p>I wouldn't call it a secret talent but I can sing. I'm pretty sure most people can sing to an extent which is why i don't really consider it a secret.</p>
                    <h2>Plans After RED</h2>
                    <p>Graduating RED is only the first step in my new chapter in life. I plan to freelance and help out upcoming companies but that's still up in the air. Whatever comes my way I plan on using my newfound skills to get though it along with growing more as a person.</p>
