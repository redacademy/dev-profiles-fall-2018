            <h3>before RED</h3>
            <p>Readers Digest version: Born in Soest, West Germany as a military brat a very long time ago,
                I grew up in Nova Scotia, went to deisgn school for 3 years in Toronto
                and I have been working as a Senior Art Director & Designer after
                graduating with honours from George Brown College in 1990,
                Some of you doing the math will figure out that I know a thing
                or two about graphics and aging..</p>

            <h3>travel</h3>
            <p>Best trip was backpacking with my nephew in Scotland. Visiting the Callanish Stones
                on the Isle of Lewis in Outer Hebrides was my favourite part.
                We gorged ourselves on huge Scottish breakfast’s that I’m sure topped 4000 cals,
                drank tons of scotch and beer and only gained 3 lbs in 13 days!
                Dragging around a 50L backback definately helped me there!</p>
