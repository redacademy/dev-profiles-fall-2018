    <h3>What I Want to Do After RED</h3> 
      <p>In my professional life so far, I've always felt like there were 2 things missing: a challenge and the feeling that I'm contributing in a positive and meaningful way.  After graduating from the Web Dev program at RED, I hope to land a Junior Developer position at a company I can really get behind.  The work itself will be the challenge I've been craving, and the company's mission will be one I believe in.  There are many causes and ideas that are improving the world we live in, and I'm excited to get inspiRED!</p>
