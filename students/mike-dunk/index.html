        Originally, I was born in McBride, BC, 3 years later we moved to Saskatchewan. I grew up around Medstead/Birch Lake, two very small farming communities on the edge of the boreal forest. Saskatchewan is very focused on agriculture but I never cared for it, rather my interests were in computers and tech and I wanted to get out and see the world which drew me to Vancouver. For the past 4 years I lived in Saskatoon where I attended the University of Saskatchewan and studied Animal Biology with an interest in evolution, adaptations, and animal body systems.
